## Design Choices

<details open> 
<summary><i>Expand Me/ Collapse Me - I'll let you decide</i></summary>

#### **Typography**

I have decided to go with 3 different fonts to keep inline with boargaming theme, please see below table for fonts and uses. I have chose these fonts to keep it clean and easy readable but to also have differentials and make the website pop a little. I will also have sans-serif font to back in case original choices fail.

| Font             |      Utilisation      |
| ---------------- | :-------------------: |
| Anton            | Main titles for pages |
| Permanent Marker |  Subtitles for pages  |
| Oswald           |   Main body of text   |

#### **Color Scheme** <!--Use a contrast site as well and mention this-->

<!--CSS Name - Color in css thats pre-determined-->

The color scheme is based of the original Gloomhaven box to keep on theme with project. [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) was the website used for color pallette.

- [Color Palette](docs/design/color-palette.png)

<!--Comment - Where is this predetermined color for-->

The below will display that I have used a contrast grid to make sure website is visually appearing but also accessible to all who will view, also I have noted the root CSS Variables I will be utilising. [Eight Shapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) was the website used for color pallette.

- [Contrast Grid](docs/design/contrast-grid.png)

- CSS Variables

All the below where contrasted then selected for the different categories and will be used as the CSS Variables thoughtout my code. Assisted by [Webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to get a visual prior to selection.

| CSS Name      |   HEX   |       RGB        | Comment                                    |
| ------------- | :-----: | :--------------: | ------------------------------------------ |
| Cafe Noir     | #513B22 |  rgb(81 59 31)   | Background for forms and unhovered buttons |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Foreground for forms and unhovered buttons |
| Captum motuum | #513125 |  rgb(81 49 37)   | Background for hovered buttons             |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Foreground for hovered buttons             |
| Bistre        | #28160A |  rgb(40 22 10)   | Background for Header and Footer           |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Foreground for Header and Footer           |
| Raw umber     | #966F51 | rgb(150 111 81)  | Highlight color in Header footer for links |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Main page Background                       |
| Bistre        | #28160A |  rgb(40 22 10)   | Main font color for main pages             |

#### **Images** <!--Insert any tools used to generate images and add which programme we used to render-->

A lot of the images were taken new by myself. However wikipedia was used for the image under the section title. Co-pilot was used for the Icons on the cards.

#### **Responsiveness**

The completed website will be responsive to the Bootstrap breakpoints, which will for all screen sizes. This is to assist all viewers to have a seemless experience within the website.

| Break Point       | Class infix | Dimensions |
| ----------------- | :---------: | ---------- |
| X-Small           |    None     | <576px     |
| Small             |     sm      | >=576px    |
| Medium            |     md      | >=768px    |
| Large             |     lg      | >=992px    |

#### **Responsivness Tests**

<details> 
<summary><i>Expand Me/ Collapse Me - I'll let you decide</i></summary>

To ensure a seamless experience across all devices, I followed a mobile-first approach during development. Starting with the smallest viewport, I designed and tested the layout on an iPhone to prioritize clarity and usability for adventurers on the go. I then progressively scaled the interface, checking responsiveness on an iPad, laptop, and full desktop display. This iterative testing helped refine layout behavior, image scaling, and content flow—ensuring the Gloomhaven Universe site remains immersive and accessible across screen sizes.

| Device  | Screen Size Range | Testing Focus                      | Result |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| iPhone  | 375px             | Mobile-first layout, image scaling | Passed |
| iPad    | 768px             | Grid wrapping, card alignment      | Passed |
| Laptop  | 1200px            | Content spacing, header behavior   | Passed |
| Desktop | 1400px            | Full-width layout, visual balance  | Passed |
